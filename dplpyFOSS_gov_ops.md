## Introduction

This Project Governance document defines operating procedures and rules aimed to clarify and support the involvement of dplPy in FOSS and the FOSS reference hub.

### Project Overview and Objectives

This section highights the dplPy project on its own and its implementation in the FOSS Reference Hub.

#### dplPy

[dplPy](https://opendendro.org/python/) is the Python implementation of the [OpenDendro](https://opendendro.org/) project, an open-source framework that aims to provide [dendrochronologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology) with the required analytical software necessary for tree-ring related research. The majority of the code for dplPy was developed by Ifeoluwa Ale, a student Computer Scienctist at the University of Arizona, and supervised by Michele Cosi, Dr. Tyson Swetnam, and Dr. Kevin Anchukaitis. OpenDendro is supervised by Dr. Kevin Anchukaitis, Andy Bunn, Dr. Tyson Swetnam and Dr. Edward Cook.

#### FOSS Reference Hub

The FOSS reference hub is a reference repository for the [Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS)](https://foss.cyverse.org/) workshop series. Together with dplPy, the aim of this repository is to serve as a reference for the [capstone](https://foss.cyverse.org/final_project/overview/), which FOSS attendees are expected to complete within the duration of the FOSS workshop.

The dplPy project was selected to enhance the FOSS Reference Hub with a reliable codebase, ensuring it mirrors a genuine repository that participants can use as a model when attempting to replicate similar setups for their individual projects.

The goals of the FOSS Reference Hub are to:
- Serve as an exemplary reference for a well structured research object.
- Guide FOSS attendees through weekly exercises designed to progressively enhance their project repositories.

### Our Team

- **Tyson Swetnam**: Co-PI of CyVerse and Director of Open Science, Institute for Computation and Data-enabled Insight (ICDI) at the University of Arizona
- **Jeff Gillan**: Data Scientist for CyVerse with relative research in the field of GIS/remote sensing.
- **Carlos Lizarraga**: Educator in Computational and Data Science at the University of Arizona Data Science Institute. Carlos' background is in applied research scientist as a Professor from the Physics Department at the University of Sonora, where he taught Computational Physics.
- **Jason Williams**: Assistant Director, Diversity and Research Readiness at the 
DNA Learning Center of Cold Spring Harbor.
- **Michele Cosi**: Science Analyst for CyVerse with a background in genetics and genomics of rice.
- **Tina Lee**: Head of User Engagement at CyVerse.
