## Introduction

This Project Governance document defines operating procedures and rules aimed to clarify and support the involvement of dplPy in FOSS and the FOSS reference hub.

### Project Overview and Objectives

This section highights the dplPy project on its own and its implementation in the FOSS Reference Hub.

#### dplPy

[dplPy](https://opendendro.org/python/) is the Python implementation of the [OpenDendro](https://opendendro.org/) project, an open-source framework that aims to provide [dendrochronologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology) with the required analytical software necessary for tree-ring related research. The majority of the code for dplPy was developed by Ifeoluwa Ale, a student Computer Scienctist at the University of Arizona, and supervised by Michele Cosi, Dr. Tyson Swetnam, and Dr. Kevin Anchukaitis. OpenDendro is supervised by Dr. Kevin Anchukaitis, Andy Bunn, Dr. Tyson Swetnam and Dr. Edward Cook.

#### FOSS Reference Hub

The FOSS reference hub is a reference repository for the [Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS)](https://foss.cyverse.org/) workshop series. Together with dplPy, the aim of this repository is to serve as a reference for the [capstone](https://foss.cyverse.org/final_project/overview/), which FOSS attendees are expected to complete within the duration of the FOSS workshop.

The dplPy project was selected to enhance the FOSS Reference Hub with a reliable codebase, ensuring it mirrors a genuine repository that participants can use as a model when attempting to replicate similar setups for their individual projects.

The goals of the FOSS Reference Hub are to:
- Serve as an exemplary reference for a well structured research object.
- Guide FOSS attendees through weekly exercises designed to progressively enhance their project repositories.

### Our Team

Meet the education team at CyVerse/Data Science Institute:
- **Tyson Swetnam**: Co-PI of CyVerse and Director of Open Science, Institute for Computation and Data-enabled Insight (ICDI) at the University of Arizona
- **Jeff Gillan**: Data Scientist for CyVerse with relative research in the field of GIS/remote sensing.
- **Carlos Lizarraga**: Educator in Computational and Data Science at the University of Arizona Data Science Institute. Carlos' background is in applied research scientist as a Professor from the Physics Department at the University of Sonora, where he taught Computational Physics.
- **Michele Cosi**: Science Analyst for CyVerse with a background in genetics and genomics of rice.
- **Tina Lee**: Head of User Engagement at CyVerse.

With the collaboration of the dplPy team: 
- **Andy Bunn**: Environmental scientist interested in climate and energy from the College of Environment at Western Washington University, founding director of the Institute for Energy Studies, and main writer of openDendro software dplR and xDateR. 
- **Edward Cook**: expert in the dendrochronology field and main writer of the tool ARSTAN. 
- **Kevin Anchukaitis**: Climate scientist, paleoclimatologist, dendrochronologist, faculty member  in Geosciences and the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona, leading the efforts behind the openDendro platform.
- **Ifeuwa Ale**: Junior Computer Science student at the University of Arizona and main contributor to the dplPy codebase for openDendro

FOSS will also be hosting the following guest speakers:
- **Jason Williams**: Assistant Director, Diversity and Research Readiness at the 
DNA Learning Center of Cold Spring Harbor.
- **Wade Bishop**: Professor in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. He is the Director of Graduate Studies as well as the Research Data Management Certificate Coordinator
