# The FOSS Reference Hub   

This GitHub page is a reference and companion repository to the [FOSS 2023 course](https://foss.cyverse.org/).

## Objective

The goal of this page is to provide FOSS learners with an idea of what (hopefully) a well constructed GitHub repository should look like.
Throughout FOSS, learners will be given the opportunity to reinforce their knowledge through self-paced assignments: a novel topic will be covered each week, and at the end of the lesson learners will be asked to add their newly gained knowledge to their own GitHub repository. This repository aims to be a reference learners can use when adding to their own work.
